# enocean_webthing
A web-connected enocean gateway. This project provides a [webthing API](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/) for an enocean gateway like the [EnOcean USB 300 USB gateway](https://www.enocean.com/de/produkt/usb-300-500u-400j/).

The enocean_webthing package provides a http webthing endpoint that supports enocean devices.

E.g.
```
# webthing has been started on host 192.168.0.23

curl http://192.168.1.198:9090/0/properties

   "eep_id":"F6:10:00",
   "enocean_id":"81:00:F0:4E",
   "state":3
